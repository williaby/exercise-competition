## Overview

Weekly exercise competition tracker with leaderboard

This project provides:
- Core functionality for weekly exercise competition tracker with leaderboard
- Production-ready code with comprehensive testing
- Well-documented API and architecture
- Security-first development practices

## Features

- **High Quality**: 80%+ test coverage enforced via CI
- **Type Safe**: Full type hints with BasedPyright strict mode
- **Well Documented**: Clear docstrings and comprehensive guides
- **Developer Friendly**: Pre-commit hooks, automated formatting, linting
- **Security First**: Dependency scanning, security analysis, SBOM generation

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+ (tested with 3.12)
- [UV](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for dependency management

**Install UV**:

```bash
# macOS and Linux
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Windows
powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"

# Or with pip/pipx
pip install uv
# or
pipx install uv
```

### Installation

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/ByronWilliamsCPA/exercise-competition.git
cd exercise_competition

# Install dependencies (includes dev tools - REQUIRED for development)
uv sync --all-extras

# Setup pre-commit hooks (required)
uv run pre-commit install
```

### Basic Usage

```python
# Import and use the package
from exercise_competition import YourModule

# Example: Create an instance and use it
module = YourModule()
result = module.process()
print(result)
```

## Frontend Development

The frontend is a React + TypeScript application built with Vite.

### Quick Start

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Frontend runs at http://localhost:3000 with hot reload.

### Available Scripts

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `npm run dev` | Start dev server with HMR |
| `npm run build` | Build for production |
| `npm run test` | Run tests in watch mode |
| `npm run lint` | Lint code |
| `npm run typecheck` | Run TypeScript type checking |
| `npm run generate-client` | Generate API client from OpenAPI |

### API Client Generation

Generate a type-safe TypeScript client from the FastAPI OpenAPI schema:

```bash
# Start backend first
uv run uvicorn exercise_competition.main:app &

# Generate client
cd frontend && npm run generate-client
```

This creates typed API functions in `frontend/src/client/`.

### Docker

```bash
# Development (with hot reload)
docker-compose up frontend

# Production build
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.prod.yml up frontend
```

## Google Assured OSS Integration

This project can use **Google Assured OSS** as the primary package source for enhanced supply chain security.

### Enabling Supply Chain Security

To enable full supply chain security features, regenerate this project with:
```bash
cruft update
# Select include_supply_chain_security: yes
```

Or manually configure by following the [Google Assured OSS documentation](https://cloud.google.com/assured-open-source-software/docs).

## Development

### Setup Development Environment

```bash
# Install all dependencies including dev tools
uv sync --all-extras

# Setup pre-commit hooks
uv run pre-commit install

# Install Qlty CLI for unified code quality checks
curl https://qlty.sh | bash

# Run tests
uv run pytest -v

# Run with coverage
uv run pytest --cov=exercise_competition --cov-report=html

# Run all quality checks (using Qlty)
qlty check

# Or use pre-commit
uv run pre-commit run --all-files
```

### Code Quality Standards

All code must meet these requirements:

- **Formatting**: Ruff (88 char limit)
- **Linting**: Ruff with PyStrict-aligned rules (see below)
- **Type Checking**: BasedPyright strict mode
- **Testing**: Pytest with 80%+ coverage
- **Security**: Bandit + dependency scanning
- **Documentation**: Docstrings on all public APIs

**Unified Quality Tool**: This project uses [Qlty](https://qlty.sh) to consolidate all quality checks into a single fast tool. See [`.qlty/qlty.toml`](.qlty/qlty.toml) for configuration.

### PyStrict-Aligned Ruff Configuration

This project uses **PyStrict-aligned Ruff rules** for stricter code quality enforcement beyond standard Python linting:

| Rule | Category | Purpose |
|------|----------|---------|
| **BLE** | Blind except | Prevent bare `except:` clauses |
| **EM** | Error messages | Enforce descriptive error messages |
| **SLF** | Private access | Prevent access to private members |
| **INP** | Implicit packages | Require explicit `__init__.py` |
| **ISC** | Implicit concatenation | Prevent implicit string concatenation |
| **PGH** | Pygrep hooks | Advanced pattern-based checks |
| **RSE** | Raise statement | Proper exception raising |
| **TID** | Tidy imports | Clean import organization |
| **YTT** | sys.version | Safe version checking |
| **FA** | Future annotations | Modern annotation syntax |
| **T10** | Debugger | No debugger statements in production |
| **G** | Logging format | Safe logging string formatting |

These rules catch bugs that standard linting misses and enforce production-quality code patterns.

### Claude Code Standards

This project includes standardized Claude Code configuration via git subtree:

**Directory Structure**:
```
.claude/
├── claude.md          # Project-specific Claude guidelines
└── standard/          # Standard Claude configuration (git subtree)
    ├── CLAUDE.md      # Universal development standards
    ├── commands/      # Custom slash commands
    ├── skills/        # Reusable skills
    └── agents/        # Specialized agents
```

**Updating Standards**:
```bash
# Pull latest standards from upstream
./scripts/update-claude-standards.sh

# Or manually
git subtree pull --prefix .claude/standard \
    https://github.com/williaby/.claude.git main --squash
```

**What's Included**:
- Universal development best practices
- Response-Aware Development (RAD) system for assumption tagging
- Agent assignment patterns and workflow
- Security requirements and pre-commit standards
- Git workflow and commit conventions

**Project-Specific Overrides**: Edit `.claude/claude.md` for project-specific guidelines. See [`.claude/README.md`](.claude/README.md) for details.

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
uv run pytest -v

# Run specific test file
uv run pytest tests/unit/test_module.py -v

# Run with coverage report
uv run pytest --cov=exercise_competition --cov-report=term-missing

# Run tests in parallel
uv run pytest -n auto
```

### Quality Checks with Qlty

**Recommended**: Use Qlty CLI for unified code quality checks.

```bash
# Run all quality checks (fast!)
qlty check

# Run checks on only changed files (fastest)
qlty check --filter=diff

# Run specific plugins only
qlty check --plugin ruff --plugin pyright

# Auto-format code
qlty fmt

# View current configuration
qlty config show
```

**Qlty runs all these tools in a single pass:**

**Python Quality:**

- Ruff (linting + formatting)
- BasedPyright (type checking)
- Bandit (security scanning)

**Security & Secrets:**

- Gitleaks (secrets detection)
- TruffleHog (entropy-based secrets detection)
- OSV Scanner (dependency vulnerabilities)
- Semgrep (advanced SAST)

**File & Configuration:**

- Markdownlint (markdown linting)
- Yamllint (YAML linting)
- Prettier (JSON, YAML, Markdown formatting)
- Actionlint (GitHub Actions workflows)
- Shellcheck (shell script linting)

**Container & Infrastructure** (if Docker enabled):

- Hadolint (Dockerfile linting)
- Trivy (container security scanning)
- Checkov (infrastructure as code security)

**Code Quality Metrics:**

- Complexity analysis (cyclomatic, cognitive)
- Code smells detection
- Maintainability scoring

### Individual Tool Commands (if needed)

```bash
# Format code
uv run ruff format src tests

# Lint and auto-fix
uv run ruff check --fix src tests

# Type checking
uv run basedpyright src

# Security scanning
uv run bandit -r src

# Dependency vulnerabilities
qlty check --plugin osv_scanner
```

## Versioning

This project uses [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/):

- **MAJOR** version: Incompatible API changes
- **MINOR** version: Backwards-compatible functionality additions
- **PATCH** version: Backwards-compatible bug fixes

Current version: **0.1.0**

### Automated Releases with Semantic Release

This project uses [python-semantic-release](https://python-semantic-release.readthedocs.io/) for automated versioning based on [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/).

**How it works:**

1. **Commit messages determine version bumps:**
   - `fix:` commits trigger a **PATCH** release (1.0.0 → 1.0.1)
   - `feat:` commits trigger a **MINOR** release (1.0.0 → 1.1.0)
   - `BREAKING CHANGE:` in commit body or `!` after type triggers **MAJOR** release (1.0.0 → 2.0.0)

2. **On merge to main:**
   - Analyzes commits since last release
   - Determines appropriate version bump
   - Updates version in `pyproject.toml`
   - Generates/updates `CHANGELOG.md`
   - Creates Git tag and GitHub Release
   - Publishes to PyPI (if configured)

**Commit message examples:**

```bash
# Patch release (bug fix)
git commit -m "fix: resolve null pointer in data parser"

# Minor release (new feature)
git commit -m "feat: add CSV export functionality"

# Major release (breaking change)
git commit -m "feat!: redesign API for better ergonomics

BREAKING CHANGE: API has been redesigned for improved usability.
See migration guide in docs/migration/v2.0.0.md"
```

**Configuration:** See `[tool.semantic_release]` in `pyproject.toml` for settings.

## Template Maintenance

This project was generated from a cookiecutter template and is managed with cruft.

### Updating from Template

To sync with the latest template changes:

```bash
# Preview changes first
cruft diff

# Apply updates (recommended: use the wrapper script)
./scripts/cruft-update.sh

# Or use cruft directly (requires manual cleanup)
cruft update
python scripts/cleanup_conditional_files.py
```

### Important: Cruft Update Limitations

**Cruft only syncs file contents** - it does NOT re-run post-generation hooks that clean up conditional files.

When you change feature flags in `.cruft.json` (e.g., disabling `include_api_framework`), the corresponding files are NOT automatically removed. You must run the cleanup script:

```bash
# Check for orphaned files
python scripts/check_orphaned_files.py

# Remove orphaned files
python scripts/cleanup_conditional_files.py

# Or preview what would be removed
python scripts/cleanup_conditional_files.py --dry-run
```

### Conditional Files

Files that may need cleanup when features are disabled:

| Feature | Files to Remove |
|---------|-----------------|
| `include_api_framework: no` | `src/*/api/`, `src/*/middleware/` |
| `include_sentry: no` | `src/*/core/sentry.py` |
| `include_background_jobs: no` | `src/*/jobs/` |
| `include_caching: no` | `src/*/core/cache.py` |
| `include_docker: no` | `Dockerfile`, `docker-compose*.yml` |
| `use_mkdocs: no` | `mkdocs.yml`, `docs/` |

The CI pipeline includes automated checks for orphaned files to prevent this issue.
