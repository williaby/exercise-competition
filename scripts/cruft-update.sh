# Wrapper script for cruft update that also cleans up conditional files.
#
# USAGE:
#   ./scripts/cruft-update.sh [cruft-options]
#
# DESCRIPTION:
#   This script wraps `cruft update` to address a fundamental limitation:
#   cruft only syncs file contents - it does NOT re-run post-generation
#   hooks that clean up conditional files.
#
#   Running this script ensures that:
#   1. Template updates are applied via `cruft update`
#   2. Orphaned conditional files are removed based on .cruft.json context
#
# EXAMPLES:
#   # Standard update
#   ./scripts/cruft-update.sh
#
#   # Update without prompts (skip conflicts)
#   ./scripts/cruft-update.sh --skip
#
#   # Update from specific commit
#   ./scripts/cruft-update.sh --checkout abc123
#
# SEE ALSO:
#   scripts/cleanup_conditional_files.py - Standalone cleanup script
#   scripts/check_orphaned_files.py - Validation script (used in CI)
